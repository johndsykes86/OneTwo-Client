# Approach

What is approach?

No, I'm kidding.

I went in with a very big idea of building a data comparsion app for MLS players and realized I had to pare that down very fast.

I pivoted about a day in and decided to build a four-square like app for being able to check in after having a conversation about MLB stadiums me and a friend had.

I went off on a lot of tagents with this project. From wanting to implement geolocation to flipping between UI frameworks. I learned there's a lot out there I don't know but a lot I can learn...now at least.

Unfortunately, the amount of tangents I went on (and being sick during project week) limited my MVP. I dont feel like this is my best work but the project I learned the most from.
